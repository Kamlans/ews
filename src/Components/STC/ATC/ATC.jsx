It is often seen that traffic lights are time driven, i.e. they change color after certain interval of time irrespective of the number of vehicles waiting to pass. But that is non-productive. We propose to control the traffic based on the traffic density. The entire traffic management can be done automatically with minimum human intervention. The emergency vehicles will be given priority. Traffic rule violators are caught automatically" />
